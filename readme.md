# Tier 1 | JavaScript Applications

This repository consists of a collection of simple JavaScript Apps written with pure vanilla JavaScript. They are meant to be effective in their design and codebase without relying too much on external frameworks, APIs, etc. That being said, I did include Bootstrap 5 in this project in an effort to better understand its capabilities.<br>

## Topics covered include:
* [x] Markdown Syntax
* [x] Basic JavaScript (variables, methods, operators, etc.)
* [x] Asynchronous JavaScript
* [x] DOM Manipulation
* [x] Debugging (browser, extensions, built-in)
* [x] Bootstrap 5
* [x] Date() Data Constructor
* [x] and more.
